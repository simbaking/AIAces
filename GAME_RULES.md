## Goal
Get to Ace by playing cards on your stack in order (either strictly up or strictly down).

## Setup
- Each player has their own stack
- If starting card is Ace or Joker, draw a new one
- **Win Condition**: Play an Ace on your stack (Joker CANNOT be used as Ace to win)

## Turn Structure
1. Draw a card
2. Choose ONE action:
   - **Advance stack**: Play as many cards as possible in order (up or down)
   - **Discard + Ability**: Discard one card and trigger its effect

## Discard Special Abilities

| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| 3 | Draw 3 cards |
| 4 | Skip next TWO players (or skip 1 in 2-player) |
| 5 | Draw 1 card |
| 6 | Skip next player |
| 7 | If suit matches card under draw pile (2P) or color (3P), place any card from hand onto opponent's stack |
| 8 | Pick random card from someone's hand. In 3+ player: can alternatively take top of someone's stack/discard |
| 9 | Skip next player |
| 10 | Take top 3 cards from anyone's stack (only if stack has 4+ cards) |
| Jack | REVERSE play direction. In 2-player: acts as SKIP |
| Queen | Look at top 3 of draw deck, pick 1 for hand |
| Joker (discard) | Move 2 cards from your discard pile to your stack |
| Joker (stack) | Wild card (plays on anything) |

## Special Rules
- **Jokers**: Wild, work as any card EXCEPT for winning
- **Empty Draw Pile**: Shuffle all discard piles to create new draw pile
- **3+ Players**: Consider using multiple decks
- **Slap/Tap**: Before opponent moves a played card, must slap on it

## Player Count Modifiers
- **2 Players**: 
  - 4 = Skip 1 (instead of 2)
  - Jack = Skip (instead of Reverse)
  - 7 = Match SUIT of card under draw pile
- **3+ Players**:
  - 7 = Match COLOR of card under draw pile
  - 8 = Can take from stack/discard instead of hand
